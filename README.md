# WiSDoM: Weakly-Supervised Density Matrices for Digital Pathology

Implementation of "Interpretable weakly-supervised learning through kernel density matrices: a digital pathology use case" for prostate cancer grading.

## Overview

WiSDoM unifies fully-supervised and weakly-supervised learning through kernel density matrices (KDM), achieving Îº=0.930 on ISUP grading while providing interpretable outputs: posterior distributions, uncertainty maps, and learned prototypes.
